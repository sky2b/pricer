<h2>Repricing and data mining</h2>

<p>Competitive pricing is the key to achieving sustained sales growth. At first glance
simple, repricing poses many challenges. Complexity comes from the need to perform
many operations: data mining from multiple sources, analyses, historical data
storage, etc. To make things worse you also need to adopt to constantly changing
environment and to be able to explore new possibilities promptly.</p>

<p>On Amazon, for example, many listings change
daily. And if for a few products it is feasible to tweak
 prices manually, as the number of products increases, this procedure becomes
too tedious and begs for automation.</p>

<p>As always, when dealing with tasks which are complex and diverse in their nature,
it is hard to come with one fits all solution. Comprehensive out of the box software
solutions tend to be both pretty restrictive and, in the same time,
full of screens, dialogs and numerous unused options.
In-house software development also comes with its
own set of problems to work through: it could be costly and it is always an
interactive process, involving trial and error learning. AddPricer is somewhere in between -
it is a collection of ready available functional blocks designed with
interoperability in mind.</p>

<h2>AddGears components for data-mining and repricing</h2>

<p>Built on top of <a href="http://addgears.com/addgears.html">AddGears</a>, AddPricer provides components
for declarative data harvesting and extraction. Every component performs some specific operation
and could be configured using
XML. For example, <code>&lt;scraper&gt;</code> component parses HTML page and could be instructed to
select particular DOM elements and take text or attribute value.
Just using CSS selectors and a <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> filter, someone can configure component to
extract prices from Amazon listings page:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;scraper path=&quot;body&quot; to=&quot;item.listing&quot;&gt;
    &lt;property selector=&quot;.olpOffer&quot; first=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;price&quot; selector=&quot;.olpOfferPrice&quot;&gt;
            &lt;number/&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/scraper&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another <code>&lt;harvester&gt;</code> <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/webcrawler.html">component</a> can be used
to crawl web pages (with page caching, proxies and anonymous crawling via Tor network).</p>

<p>All components execute in the context of the execution <em>namespace</em> - shared data tree where
components can get/store data, thus communicating with each other. In the example above,
the <code>body</code> variable should contain an HTML page
content, and an extracted price object is stored in the namespace, in a <code>listing</code> property
of the <code>item</code> object.</p>

<p>In addition to these useful components, AddPricer has a full access to all the
functionality of AddGears:
configurable components (SQL, file IO, client/server HTTP,
built-in scripting language, etc)
and ecosystem in general, including <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/makefiles.html">makefiles</a>.</p>

<p>Makefiles are an ideal tool when someone wants to split and combine
complex operations:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml"># a makefile target which reads a *.csv file and stores it in a &quot;data&quot; namespace variable
read-file:
    params:
        file: products.csv
    run: read-file.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

# a makefile target which prints &quot;data&quot; namespace variable
print-data:
    run: print-data.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

# a makefile target which harvests HTML pages for products in &quot;data&quot; namespace variable
harvest:
    run: harvest.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

# a makefile target which scrapes HTML pages to extract pricing information
scrape:
    run: scrape.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

# a makefile target which updates prices in MySQL table
update:
    run: update.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

# a compound target, combining multiple targets defined before
all:
    - read-file
    - print-data
    - harvest
    - scrape
    - print-data
    - update
</code></pre>

<p>Taking advantage of a shared namespace and using consistent naming conventions, its
easy to divide complex tasks into small elementary steps which could be separately tested,
and then reused in various scenarios. Different targets could be combined and invoked from
command line. To make for flexibility AddPricer stops short of providing finished web application,
providing all the tools and example HTML pages. So that when necessary repricing could be wrapped into an
REST API using handy AddGears HTTP handler component.</p>

<h2>Where to go next</h2>

<p>All components and there attributes are <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/docs/api.html">documented</a>.
In addition AddGears comes with
examples and step by step <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/getting-started.html">tutorial</a>.
This tutorial shows how to solve practical everyday problems: harvest and scrape HTML pages,
create HTTP API endpoints, perform file IO and MySQL data retrieval, etc.</p>

<p>AddPricer is not bound to any server or cloud platform. It
could be <a href="http://pricer.addgears.com/download.html">downloaded</a><br />
and used it on premises (see also <a href="installation.html">installation</a> instructions),
along with practically any technology stack.
Or we can <a href="http://pricer.addgears.com/pricing.html">install, support and develop</a> AddPricer
based applications for you.</p>
