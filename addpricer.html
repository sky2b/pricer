<h1>AddPricer: AddGears components for data-mining and repricing</h1>

<p>Competitive pricing is the key to achieving sustained sales growth. At first glance
simple, repricing poses many challenges. Complexity comes from the need to perform
many operations: data collection from multiple sources, analyses, historical data
storage, etc. To make things worse you also need to adopt to constantly changing
environment and to be able to explore new possibilities promptly.</p>

<p>For example, on Amazon many books listings change
daily and even more frequently. And if for a few products it is feasible to tweak your
 prices manually, as the number of products increases, this procedure becomes
too tedious and begs for automation.</p>

<p>As always, possible solutions range from writing your own software from scratch
to buying ready available comprehensive software suits. Out of the box software
solutions tend to be both pretty restrictive and, in the same time,
full of screens, dialogs and numerous unused options.
In-house software development also comes with its
own set of problems to work through: it could be costly and it is always an
interactive process, involving trial and error learning.</p>

<p>Where in this picture fits AddPricer? It is different as it first of all aims to
provide a set of useful tools, a set of Lego blocks, not a comprehensive black
box solution. It builds on top of AddGears adding a few components to harvest and
scape data from HTML.</p>

<p>AddGears comes with a few configurable and easily reusable components and general
ecosystem of makefiles, configuration files and templates, providing a framework
to combine and build new reusable blocks and flexible enterprise solutions on
top of them. It turns out that to achieve many goals
we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to write a code. Flexible configuration system, templates, SQL
and little bit of scripting is often more then enough to solve many real world problems.</p>

<p>AddPricer adheres to the AddGears philosophy and aims to provide a tool useful
to a broad business community, without loosing its main focus on repricing.
We think that competitive pricing first of all implies data acquisition and some
number crunching, for which special components are provided. And a natural synergy
with AddGears results in a functionality that makes it able to manage a complete
business data flow: web harvesting, database import\export, file operations, HTTP
endpoints - many ingredients that help business to be highly competitive and efficient.</p>

<p>To make for flexibility AddPricer stops short of providing any web interface though.
Just leaving user with all the tools necessary. It seems like a good text editor
is actually the best user interface for data processing. Textual information is
both easy for humans to digest and convenient to share data between applications (think of SQL
databases, spreadsheets, third party software etc). Any GUI on the other hand immediately
imposes limitations and should be used wisely. When you do need some UI - to give
it to your customers or as a tool to support business operations - AddGears comes with
simple components which allow users to create database backed web servers.</p>
